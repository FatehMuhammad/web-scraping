# web-scraping
I have done web-scraping using python. This Program will take input of "product name" from user. For that specific Product, it will scrap some data from Daraz and at the end show data for top 5 products as output along with a csv file containing rest of the data. 

Required Output : This file will tell us, what exactly we have to do in this project.
Sample.csv : This File is sample of the data, after completing this project, our program should give us scraped data in a scrapedData.csv file.
ChromeDriver: Make sure ChromeDriver.exe is compatible with your version of browser, specifically chrome Browser and is in the right path.
MobileDataScraped : This file have output of this python Program, for input Mobile Covers.
